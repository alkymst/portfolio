1. Create a new folder in the wp-content/plugins directory and add a new PHP file with the same name as the folder. This will be your main plugin file. Add the basic plugin header information, such as the plugin name and version, in this file.
2. Enqueue your React files by adding a function to your plugin that hooks into the wp_enqueue_scripts action and then using the wp_enqueue_script function to add your React files.
3. Create a new JavaScript file and write your React component using JSX syntax.
4. Register a shortcode in your plugin and use the add_shortcode function to register the shortcode. This is where your React component will be rendered.
5. Finally, activate your plugin by going to the Plugins section of the WordPress admin area and clicking on Activate.

Example of enqueuing React files:
```php
function enqueue_react_files() {
    wp_enqueue_script( 'react', 'https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js', array(), '16.13.1', true );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'react-dom', 'https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js', array(), '16.13.1', true );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'my-react-component', plugins_url( 'dist/my-react-component.js', __FILE__ ), array('react', 'react-dom'), '1.0', true );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'enqueue_react_files' );
```

Example of register a shortcode and render react component:
```php
function render_react_component() {
    return '<div id="my-react-component"></div>';
}
add_shortcode( 'my-react-component', 'render_react_component' );
```


To transpile and bundle your React component, you can use Babel and Webpack. Here's an example of how to set this up:

6. Install necessary dependencies by running `npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-react webpack webpack-cli`
7. Create a new file named webpack.config.js in the root of your plugin directory with the following content:

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'my-react-component.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

8. Create a new file named .babelrc in the root of your plugin directory with the following content:
```js
{
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-react"
  ]
}
```

9. Create a new directory named src in the root of your plugin directory and add your React component in src/index.js
10. Add the following script in your package.json file to run webpack:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --mode development"
  },
```

Run `npm run build` to transpile your React component and bundle it with webpack. The output file `my-react-component.js` will be generated in the dist directory and you can enqueue it in your WordPress plugin as described in the previous examples.

It's worth noting that you can use the `--mode production` flag when building the bundle for production to optimize the build for production. You can also use plugins like `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin` or `terser-webpack-plugin` to minify your code and make it more efficient.

In summary, creating a WordPress plugin using React can be a bit tricky, but it is definitely possible. By following the steps outlined in this post, you can set up a new plugin, enqueue your React files, build your React component, render it on the front-end of your WordPress site, and use Babel and Webpack to transpile and bundle your code for optimal performance.
